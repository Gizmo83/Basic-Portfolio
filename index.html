            <p>Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air</p>
            <br>
            <p>In West Philadelphia, born and raised on the playground is where I spent most of my days Chillin' out, maxin'm relaxin' all cool and shootin' some b-ball outisde of the school when a couple of guys who were up to no good started makin' trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared and said "You're movin' with your aunit and uncle in Bel Air</p>
            <br>
            <p>I begged and pleaded with her day after day but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way she gave me a kiss and then she gave me a ticket I put my Walkman on and said "I might as well kick it" first class, yo, this is bad drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass is this what the people of Bel Air livin' like?</p>
